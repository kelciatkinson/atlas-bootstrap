## Project Overview
In this project, I used HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to implement a functional and responsive website for a fictional pickleball club. The website adapts to various screen sizes and includes sections like testimonials, sign-up forms, and carousels to display key club images.

## Features
### Responsive Layout:
The layout adjusts based on screen size, ensuring an optimal experience across devices.
Carousel: Both single and multi-item carousels to showcase content.
Responsive Navigation: A navbar that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Drop Down Menus: For user interaction with available options.
Aside Section: An aside element used for additional club-related content.
Footer: Contains "social media links", and a faux copyright.
## Technology Stack
HTML5 – Used for structuring the web pages.
CSS3 – Styling the design with a focus on responsiveness and accessibility.
Bootstrap – For a mobile-first responsive design and various components like carousels and dropdowns.
jQuery – For JavaScript functionality in Bootstrap components like carousels and dropdown menus.
